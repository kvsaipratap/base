1. Students who got "mostly A" on their recent report card - how much parental involvement contributed to this? Which variables would you choose to study this effect?

2. In households where mothers do more household work than dads are there any indications that children have development challenges. If so, what factors did you consider?

3. Compare the groups - "those who never play video games" vs "those who play video games every day". Find at least 5 traits that are different in these groups. Carry out a similar exercise with "time playing sports with friends" - those who do so often, vs those who do so rarely or never.
